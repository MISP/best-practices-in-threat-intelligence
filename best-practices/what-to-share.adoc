=== What To Share or What Counts As Valuable Information?

NOTE: Valuable information is a moving concept and depends highly on the goal of the users sharing and/or using the information. A valuable information can also evolve following the capabilities of an organisation.

Contribution comes in various shapes and sizes.

Information which is often distributed within sharing communities are the following:

- Analysis report of a specific threat (such as security vendor report, blog post) which can be Open Source intelligence or come as limited distribution
- Enhanced analysis of an existing report (such as data qualification, competitive or counter analysis)
- A post-mortem analysis of an incident
- Additional information about existing or known threats (such as adversary techniques, new malware samples or complementary discoveries)
- False-positive or false-negative reporting
- Asking for contribution or support from the community (such as "have you seen this threat?" or "do you have more samples?" as described in https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_collaborative_intelligence[collaborative intelligence] taxonomy)

TIP: By having a look at https://www.misp-project.org/objects.html[the object templates] or the https://www.misp-project.org/datamodels/#misp-core-format[MISP attribute types], this can help you discover what is actively shared within other communities. If a type or an object template is not matching your data model, you can easily create new ones.

TIP: When asking for the support of the community, using a specific taxonomy such as https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_collaborative_intelligence[collaborative intelligence] to express your needs, will make your request more concise improving your feedback potential and improve automation.

TIP: MISP allows to extend an existing event without touching the original event. This feature can be used to enhance analysis without affecting the original ones and creating new distribution levels.
